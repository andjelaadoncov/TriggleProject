# Triggle Project  

**Triggle – Strategic Triangle Occupation Game**

**Overview:**  
This project is developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Niš. It is an implementation of the popular game **Triggle**, written in **Python**, where players strategically compete to occupy triangles on a hexagonal board.  

**Phases of Development:**  
 > **Phase 1: Problem Formulation and Interface Design**  
   - Define game rules, initial board setup, and user interface.  

 > **Phase 2: State Change Operators and Game Mechanics**  
   - Implement game logic, move validation, and dynamic state updates.  

 > **Phase 3: AI Implementation and Heuristic Design**  
   - Develop an AI opponent using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning and state evaluation based on rule-based heuristics.  

This project is written in **Python** and uses AI techniques in game development.
